        <h3 class="centre">Manali</h3>
        <p><strong>Manali</strong> is a resort town nestled in the mountains of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh near the northern end of the Kullu Valley in the Beas River Valley. It is a popular tourist destination and serves as the gateway to Lahaul and Spiti district as well as Leh. The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of <strong>Manu-Alaya</strong> which literally means <strong>the abode of Manu</strong>. Legend has it that sage Manu stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. Manali lies in the North of Kullu Valley. The valley is often referred to as the <strong>Valley of the Gods</strong>. Old Manali village has an ancient temple dedicated to sage Manu.</p>

        <p>Nestled in the mighty Himalayas, Manali has an abundance of spectacular valleys filled with forests of oak, fir, deodar and pine. It is a full package of nature, food, adventure sports and ancient heritages. Splashing river Beas flows proudly amidst the valley. A lot of gushing waterfalls like <span>Jogni falls and Rahala fall</span> flush out of haphazardly placed rocks. You can also catch sights of sprawling meadows, terraced farming and fruit orchards. All these sights adds up to making the town look breathtakingly beautiful.</p>

        <p>Having said enough about the terrains of Manali, it is a hub for adventure sports. The location gives a wide range of adventurous activities like paragliding, camping, trekking and river rafting to feed the adrenaline hunger of the adventure seekers. It also has rustic villages and backcountries, which calls for the hippie experiences.</p>

        <p>Manali is no less than a box full of an array of sweets. You can dig in it and collect as many gems as you want. And by gems, it means <strong>‘memories’</strong>. Wait no longer and pack all that you need for a fun-filled trip. Grab your laptop to book your tickets and head off to this lovely place to have some experiences to cherish throughout your life.</p>
